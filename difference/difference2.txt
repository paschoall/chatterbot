 -?difference? defect and failure
>A defect (or fault) is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program. A defect can lead the program or software to a failure, i.e an incorrect result. Therefore, a failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected.
 
-?difference? defect and error
> A defect (or fault) is an incorrect step, process, or data definition in computer program, which may lead the program to an error, which is a unexpected state of execution that can cause a program failure. If you're still confused, ask me what a failure is.

-?difference? failure and error
>A failure is a result of the program which is incorrect or not expected. This is caused by an error, which is an unexpected state of program execution and, if this state is propagated to the final sate of the program may lead to an incorrect result, that is a program failure.
